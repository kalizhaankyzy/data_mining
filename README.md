# Data Mining Projects Repository

## Overview
This repository serves as a collection of projects focused on data mining techniques, including data exploration, pattern recognition, and visualization. Each project applies different methodologies and tools to extract insights from various datasets.
These projects are from assignments for the AD699 Data Mining course.
