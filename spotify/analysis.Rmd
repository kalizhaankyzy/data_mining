library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

spotify_2023 <- read.csv('spotify-2023.csv')
View(spotify_2023)
str(spotify_2023)

spotify_2023 %>% filter(track_name == 'Money Trees')

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
